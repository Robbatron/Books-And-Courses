// A Constant Exercise of Letting Variables Be Variables

//Imagine that you are building an application to manage a user's Facebook profile.  A profile might have a 'name', 'age', and 'dateOfBirth'.

//Declare three variables with these same names, making sure to use 'const' or 'let' depending on whether you expect the value to change over time.

const name = '';
let age = '';
const dateOfBirth = '';
